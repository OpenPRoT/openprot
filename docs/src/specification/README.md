# OpenPRoT Specification

Version: v0.5 - Work in Progress

## Introduction

The concept of a Platform Root of Trust (PRoT) is central to establishing a
secure computing environment. A PRoT is a trusted component within a system that
serves as the foundation for all security operations. It is responsible for
ensuring that the system boots securely, verifying the integrity of the firmware
and software, and performing critical cryptographic functions. By acting as a
trust anchor, the PRoT provides a secure starting point from which the rest of
the system's security measures can be built. This is particularly important in
an era where cyber threats are becoming increasingly sophisticated, targeting
the lower layers of the computing stack, such as firmware, to gain persistent
access to systems.

OpenPRoT is a project intended to enhance the security and transparency of PRoTs
by defining and building an open source firmware stack that can be run on a
variety of hardware implementations. Open source firmware offers several
benefits that can enhance the effectiveness and trustworthiness of a PRoT.
Firstly, open source firmware allows for greater transparency, as the source
code is publicly available for review and audit. This transparency helps
identify and mitigate vulnerabilities more quickly, as a global community of
developers and security experts can scrutinize the code. It also reduces the
risk of hidden backdoors or malicious code, which can be a concern with
proprietary firmware.

Moreover, an open source firmware stack can foster innovation and collaboration
within the industry. By providing a common platform that is accessible to all,
developers can contribute improvements, share best practices, and develop new
security features that benefit the entire ecosystem. This collaborative approach
can lead to more robust and resilient firmware solutions, as it leverages the
collective expertise of a diverse community. Additionally, open source firmware
can enhance interoperability and reduce vendor lock-in, giving organizations
more flexibility in choosing hardware and software components that best meet
their security needs.

Incorporating an open source firmware stack into a PRoT not only strengthens the
security posture of a system but also aligns with broader industry trends
towards openness and collaboration. As organizations increasingly recognize the
importance of securing the foundational layers of their computing environments,
the combination of a PRoT with open source firmware represents a powerful
strategy for building trust and resilience in the face of evolving cyber
threats.
