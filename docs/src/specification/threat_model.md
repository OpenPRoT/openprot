## Attacker Profile

The attack profile definition is based on the [JIL](https://www.sogis.eu/documents/mra/JIL-AC-Interpretation-v1.0.pdf) Application of Attack
Potential to Smartcards and Similar Devices [Specification](https://www.sogis.eu/documents/cc/domains/sc/JIL-Application-of-Attack-Potential-to-Smartcards-v3.2.1.pdf) version 3.2.1.

-   **Type of access**: Physical, Remote
-   **Attacker Proficiency Levels**: Expert, Proficient, Laymen
-   **Knowledge of the TOE**: Public (Open source), Critical for signing keys
-   **Equipment**: None, Standard, Specialized, Bespoke

### Attacks within Scope

Following attacks are considered to be in scope. A detailed breakdown of these attacks can be found in [JIL specification](https://www.sogis.eu/documents/cc/domains/sc/JIL-Application-of-Attack-Potential-to-Smartcards-v3.2.1.pdf).

-   **Physical attacks**: Tampering with hardware, invasive probing, or extraction of secrets through physical access.
-   **Perturbation attacks**: Inducing faults (e.g., voltage glitching, clock manipulation, etc.) to alter device behavior.
-   **Side-channel attacks**: Leveraging information leakage through side-channels (e.g., timing, power, EM emission, acoustic, etc.) to infer sensitive data.
-   **Exploitation of debug/test features**: Abusing test interfaces or leftover debug functionalities to bypass security.
-   **Attacks on RNG**: Weakening or exploiting the random number generator to predict or manipulate cryptographic operations like key generation, nonce generation, etc.
-   **Software attacks**: Exploiting firmware vulnerabilities, code injection, privilege escalation, or misuse of exposed APIs/ABIs.
-   **Application isolation failures**: Attacks aiming to bypass isolation boundaries and access other application privileges, resources, or secrets.
-   **Supply chain attacks**: Compromising firmware, hardware component, or provisioning process prior to or during deployment.
-   **Insider threat**: Malicious actions by individuals with legitimate access during development or deployment.

## Threat Modeling

To provide a transparent view of the security posture for a given OpenPRoT +
hardware implementation, integrators are required to perform a threat modeling
analysis. This analysis must evaluate the specific implementation against the
assets and attacker profile defined in this document.

The results of this analysis must be documented in table format, with the
following columns:

-   **Threat ID**: Unique identifier which can be referenced in documentation and
    security audits
-   **Threat Description**: Definition of the attack profile and potential attack.
-   **Target Assets**: List of impacted assets
-   **Mitigation(s)**: List of countermeasures implemented in hardware and/or
    software to mitigate the potential attack
-   **Verification**: Results of verification plan used to gain confidence in the
    mitigation strategy.

Integrators should use the JIL specification as a guideline to identify relevant
attacks and must detail the specific mitigation strategies implemented in their
design. The table must be populated for the target hardware implementation to
allow for a comprehensive security review.

### Threat Modeling Example
In this section, we will provide an example threat modeling of TCG DICE Unique Device Secret (UDS) provisioing flow.
