# Introduction

Welcome to the OpenPRoT documentation!

This documentation provides comprehensive information about the OpenPRoT
project, including user guides, developer documentation, and API references.

## What is OpenPRoT?

OpenPRoT is an open-source, Rust-based project designed to provide a secure and
reliable foundation for platform security. It offers a flexible and extensible
framework for developing firmware and security-related applications for a
variety of platforms.

At its core, OpenPRoT provides a Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) that enables
platform-agnostic application development. On top of this HAL, it offers a suite
of services and protocols for platform security, including device attestation,
secure firmware updates, and more. The project is designed with a strong
emphasis on modern security protocols and standards, such as:

-   **SPDM (Security Protocol and Data Model):** For secure communication and
    attestation.
-   **MCTP (Management Component Transport Protocol):** As a transport for
    management and security protocols.
-   **PLDM (Platform Level Data Model):** For modeling platform components and
    their interactions.

## Project Goals

The primary goals of the OpenPRoT project are to:

-   **Promote Security:** Provide a robust and secure foundation for platform
    firmware, leveraging modern, industry-standard security protocols.
-   **Ensure Reliability:** Offer a high-quality, well-tested, and reliable
    codebase for critical platform services.
-   **Enable Extensibility:** Design a modular and extensible architecture that
    can be easily adapted to different hardware platforms and use cases.
-   **Foster Collaboration:** Build an open and collaborative community around
    platform security.
